HIGH PRIORITY
=============

API
---
  - Complete the API layer for Senlin service
  - Remove {name}/{id} kind of identifier

DB
--
  - Make sure cluster-policy association is deleted when a cluster is deleted
  - Modify node_set_status to check/update cluster status
  - Add field cluster_id to event table so that query by cluster is easier
  - Add more action related support in DB, e.g. unlock action, mark action
    control status to cancel, suspend, resume, etc. [Yanyan Hu]

ENGINE
------
  - cleanse scheduler module [Yanyan Hu]
    - service start with rpc server(eventlet) and dispatcher(subthread);
    - threadgroupmanager(TGM) module will now handle action;
    - scheduler module will wrap TGM and expose interface to dispatcher,
      e.g. run_action, wait, stop, notify;
    - dispatcher using db.api to get action and use scheduler to dispatch
      run and control action;
    - use event to control action progress: wrap action_proc into ActionRunner
      and using start/step to support event wait.
    - action(ClusterAction, NodeAction, etc.) itself has to handle its own
      progress control(e.g. implement as generator and support canceling)
  - complete parser logic, construct profile/policy objects there?

DRIVER
------
  - complete Heat stack driver
  - add Heat resource driver

POLICY
------
  - healthy policy[Liuh]
  - Policy framework [Yanyan Hu]


MIDDLE PRIORITY
===============

DB
--
  - Add test cases for policy_delete with 'force' set to True[Liuh/ZhaiHF]

ENGINE
------

  - Design and implement dynamical plugin loading mechanism that allows 
    loading plugins from any paths
  - Provide support to oslo.notification and allow nodes to receive and react
    to those notifications accordingly.

OSLO
----

  - Migrate to oslo.log
  - Migrate to oslo.context


LOW PRIORITY
============

TEST
----
  - Add test case in db cluster to test that cluster-policy association is
    deleted when we delete a cluster
  - Add test case to engine/parser
  - Add test case to engine/registry
  - Add test case to engine/environment
