High Priority
=============

DB
--
  - Make sure cluster-policy association is deleted when a cluster is deleted
  - Add field size to cluster table
  - Modify node_set_status to check/update cluster status
  - Add field cluster_id to event table so that query by cluster is easier

ENGINE
------
  - cleanse scheduler module
    - service start with rpc server(eventlet) and dispatcher(subthread);
    - threadgroupmanager(TGM) module will now handle action;
    - scheduler module will wrap TGM and expose interface to dispatcher,
      e.g. run_action, wait, stop, notify;
    - dispatcher using db.api to get action and use scheduler to dispatch
      run and control action;
  - complete parser logic, construct profile/policy objects there?

DRIVER
------
  - complete Heat stack driver [Qiming]
  - add Heat resource driver

POLICY
------
  - healthy policy[Liuh]

Middle Priority
===============

DB
--
  - Add test cases for policy_delete with 'force' set to True[Liuh/ZhaiHF]

ENGINE
------

  - Design and implement dynamical plugin loading mechanism that allows 
    loading plugins from any paths

OSLO
----

  - Migrate to oslo.log
  - Migrate to oslo.context


Low Priority
============

TEST
----
  - Add test case in db cluster to test that cluster-policy association is
    deleted when we delete a cluster
  - Add test case to engine/parser
  - Add test case to engine/registry
  - Add test case to engine/environment
