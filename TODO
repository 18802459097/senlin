HIGH PRIORITY
=============

ENGINE
------
  - cleanse scheduler module [Yanyan Hu]
    - Using python threading to replace greenthread(long term).
  - handle cancel_action() properly. When dispatcher.cancel_action() is called,
    the scheduler should check if the action is still being worked on by someone.
    It should send cancel signal, or help that action remove locks if needed.
  - Add the support for the multi-region/multi-cloud in profile (Qi Zhang)
    Need to add one more column in Profile as identifier, if the cloud is openstack,
    this identifier will be the region name which will be used to get the right service
     via openstackSDK. If the cloud type is bluemix, this will be the bluemix API address.

DRIVER
------
  - Handle Heat stack operation exception handling [Qiming]

POLICY
------
  - healthy policy[Liuh]
  - Formalize policy enforcement levels [Qiming]

TEST CASES
----------
