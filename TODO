HIGH PRIORITY
=============

DB
--
  - Modify node_set_status to check/update cluster status

ENGINE
------
  - cleanse scheduler module [Yanyan Hu]
    - Using python threading to replace greenthread(long term).
  - complete parser logic, construct profile/policy objects there?
  - handle cancel_action() properly. When dispatcher.cancel_action() is called,
    the scheduler should check if the action is still being worked on by someone.
    It should send cancel signal, or help that action remove locks if needed.

DRIVER
------
  - Handle Heat stack operation exception handling [Qiming]

POLICY
------
  - healthy policy[Liuh]
  - Formalize policy enforcement levels [Qiming]

TEST CASES
----------
  - Add test case that profile_update will create a new profile when spec is
    different.

MIDDLE PRIORITY
===============

API
---
  - Implement webhook support [Yanyan Hu]
  - Provide support for privilege management [Yanyan Hu]
    - Implement a middleware for trust handling

  - Allow actions to be paused and resumed.
    This is important for some background actions such as health checking

  - Add support to template_url for heat stack profile
    Note: if template and template_url are both specified, use template
    Need to refer to heat api test for testing heat profile

TEST
----
  - Add test case to engine/parser
  - Add test case to engine/registry
