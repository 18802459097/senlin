HIGH PRIORITY
=============

API
---
  - Complete the API layer for Senlin service

DB
--
  - Make sure cluster-policy association is deleted when a cluster is deleted
  - Modify node_set_status to check/update cluster status
  - Add field cluster_id to event table so that query by cluster is easier

ENGINE
------
  - cleanse scheduler module [Yanyan Hu]
    - Using python threading to replace greenthread(long term).
  - complete parser logic, construct profile/policy objects there?
  - handle cancel_action() properly. When dispatcher.cancel_action() is called,
    the scheduler should check if the action is still being worked on by someone.
    It should send cancel signal, or help that action remove locks if needed.

DRIVER
------
  - Handle Heat stack operation exception handling [Qiming]

POLICY
------
  - healthy policy[Liuh]
  - Policy framework [Yanyan Hu]

---

    loading plugins from any paths

  - Provide support to oslo.notification and allow nodes to receive and react
    to those notifications accordingly.
    [https://ask.openstack.org/en/question/46495/heat-autoscaling-adaptation-actions-on-existing-servers/]

  - Allow actions to be paused and resumed.
    This is important for some background actions such as health checking

OSLO
----

  - Migrate to oslo.log -- hold on, it is not stable!!!
  - Migrate to oslo.policy 

LOW PRIORITY
============

DRIVER
------
  - add Heat resource driver

----
  - Add test case in db cluster to test that cluster-policy association is
    deleted when we delete a cluster
  - Add test case to engine/parser
  - Add test case to engine/registry
  - Add test case to engine/environment
  - Add test case to db apis that query objects using short ids
